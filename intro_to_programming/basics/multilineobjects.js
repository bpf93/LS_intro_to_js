//Objects can also be written in a multi-line format, which is especially useful for larger objects or objects with long or complex values:

let x = {
  title: "Monty Python's Flying Circus",
  cast: [
    "Eric Idle",
    "John Cleese",
    "Terry Gilliam",
    "Graham Chapman",
    "Michael Palin",
    "Terry Jones",
  ],
  firstSeason: 1969,
  lastSeason: 1974,
}

let pets = {
  asta: 'dog',
  butterscotch: 'cat',
  pudding: 'cat',
  neptune: 'fish',
  darwin: 'lizard',
};

//The trailing comma on the last property in the object is optional, but a common practice. Try to be consistent in its use.
