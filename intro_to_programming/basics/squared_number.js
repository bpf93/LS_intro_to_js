/*
Write a function that accepts a single argument, 
a number, and returns the result of multiplying its 
argument by an exponent of 2 (also known as squaring 
the number).

squaredNumber(3); // 9
*/

//My answer:

function squaredNumber(num) {
  return num ** 2;
}

console.log(squaredNumber(3));

Our solution uses the exponentiation operator (**) to multiply our parameter num by the power of 2. Because squaring a number is the equivalent of multiplying the number by itself, the below solution would also be valid:

function squaredNumber(num) {
  return num * num;
}

Note that in order to return the squared number from our function we must use an explicit return statement. Otherwise, the return value of our function squaredNumber would be undefined.
