'Always bet on JavaScript.' to the console. 
What is the return value of the function?


brendanEichQuote();
// logs:
// Always bet on JavaScript.

*/

//My answer:

function brendanEichQuote() {
  console.log('Always bet on JavaScript.');
}

brendanEichQuote();

//the value of the function is undefined.

/*Answer provided:
Since the function has no return statement, 
the return value of our function is undefined.


Always be aware of the output and the return value of a
function.*/
