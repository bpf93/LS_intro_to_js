/*
Not everything between curly braces is technically a block. For instance, the braces that surround an object literal do not define a block. Technically, the braces that surround a function body don't define a block either, though it is convenient to think of function bodies as blocks. While there are similarities between blocks, function bodies, and, to a lesser degree, object literals, the term block usually refers to executable code between braces, including function bodies:
*/

{
  // this is a block
  let foo = 42;
  console.log(foo);
}

if (answer === 'yes') {
  // this is a block
  console.log('yes');
} else {
  // so is this
  console.log('nope');
}

while (answer !== 'no') {
  // this is a block
  doSomething();
}

function foo() {
  // not technically a block. However, we can treat it as a block.
  let foo = 42;               // foo has block scope
  console.log(foo);
}

let foo = {
  // this is not a block
  bar: 42,
};

/*In general, blocks appear in if...else if...else, while, do...while, for, switch, and try...catch statements, or by themselves (as in the first example above).

As mentioned above, function bodies are not technically blocks. However, they look and behave so much like blocks that many developers do not distinguish between the two. In this book and the curriculum, we'll usually treat function bodies as blocks. When we want to differentiate them or exclude function bodies from the discussion, we'll refer to non-function blocks.
