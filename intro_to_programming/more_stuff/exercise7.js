/*What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

My answer:
Exception handling is a way of managing errors when they arise
to prevent the program from failing.

Exception handling can prevent your program
from failing under unforeseen or unpredictable
circumstances, such as unexpected user input.

Answer provided:
Exception handling is a process that deals with errors in a manageable and predictable manner. It uses the try/catch statement to catch exceptions that the code in the try block raises, and lets the programmer deal with the problem in a way that makes sense and perhaps prevents a catastrophic failure or nasty bug.
